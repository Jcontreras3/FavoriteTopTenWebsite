Jovann and Caroline top 10

This is a html of our top 10 favorites. Jovann did top 10 favorite dog breeds, and Caroline did top 10 favorite music artists.

Caroline Hana- For this project I worked with Jovann, we had a first design which Ken didn’t like, so we changed it up. I think we both did the work equally, we made sure to agree on the color scheme and the template. We made sure we agreed on what cards we are using and how to set up everything. We just communicated very well with everything. Jovann is a very easy person to work with because he isn’t very picky with stuff, he states if he likes it or not, and what works with him. It was fun working with him.


Jovann Peer Review : My partner was Caroline and she did her top 10 on music artists. First thing I would say is that we had some good communication. We weren't scared to give opinions when we started designing the website and I thought that was good, the reason being is because we were able to agree on one theme for the project and keep the consistency. I would say that it did take us longer than it should have to come up with a design but in the end we ended up getting it done.
When we started coding we talked about what pages we were going to do and how we were going to get them done. We worked together by creating one nav bar to use for all the pages so that it made it easier for us to code it in. There was some errors we ran into but we fixed them quickly.
Overall Caroline was great to work with and we got all of our work done.
