Jovann and Caroline top 10

Jovann Peer Review: My partner was Caroline and she did her top 10 on music artists. First thing I would say is that we had some good communication. We weren't scared to give opinions when we started designing the website and I thought that was good, the reason being is because we were able to agree on one theme for the project and keep the consistency. I would say that it did take us longer than it should have to come up with a design but in the end we ended up getting it done.
When we started coding we talked about what pages we were going to do and how we were going to get them done. We worked together by creating one nav bar to use for all the pages so that it made it easier for us to code it in. There was some errors we ran into but we fixed them quickly.
Overall Caroline was a great partner to work with and we were able to get the project done.
