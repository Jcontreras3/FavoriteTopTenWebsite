11-10-2022
This is a html of our top 10 favorites. Jovann did top 10 favorite dog breeds, and Caroline did top 10 favorite music artists.

Caroline Hana- For this project I worked with Jovann, we had a first design which Ken didn’t like, so we changed it up. I think we both did the work equally, we made sure to agree on the color scheme and the template. We made sure we agreed on what cards we are using and how to set up everything. We just communicated very well with everything. Jovann is a very easy person to work with because he isn’t very picky with stuff, he states if he likes it or not, and what works with him. It was fun working with him.
